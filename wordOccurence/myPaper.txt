    Once ONCE upon a time there was a boy named John.
He was 11 years and decided to start a business.
He decided that the business would be a lemonade stand.
He was going to call it JOHN'S JUICY LEMONADE.
He was so excited to start.
He made an email, johnthelemonademaker@emaildomain.com so he would could manage his business
After making an email, John emailed his neighbors about his upcoming lemonade stand.
However he decided he wanted to grow bigger.
He decided to email people who owned successful lemonade stands.
Luckily, for him 2 people followed up with him.
They gave him tips for starting a successful lemonade stand.

    With the abundance of tips for starting a successful lemonade stand, \
     John was ready to officially start his lemonade stand.
First he went to his mom and exclaimed, "MOM I am going to build the best lemonade stand ever!!!!'
